Welcome to Bamazon!

This node.js / MySQL app is designed to replicate a very simple store in which the customer receives a list of items available for purchase along with the price.  Once the user selects an item it will check to verify there are sufficient items to fulfill the order and if so will provide a success result or failure if there is insufficient stock.
